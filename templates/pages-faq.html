      <h2>Stock Market</h2>

      Investing in stocks can be a rewarding way to grow your wealth over time. However, if you're new to the world of
      stocks, the terminology and concepts can seem overwhelming. This section aims to demystify the basics of stocks,
      why
      people trade them, and how the trading process works.

      <br><br>
      <h5>What is a Stock?</h5>
      A stock, also known as a share or equity, represents ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a
      shareholder and have a claim on the company's assets and earnings. In simple terms, owning a stock means you own a
      small piece of that company.
      <br><br>
      <h5>Why Do People Trade Stocks?</h5>
      People trade stocks for various reasons, but the primary motivation is to make a profit. Investing in stocks
      provides an opportunity to grow your money as the value of the stocks can increase over time. Additionally, some
      companies distribute a portion of their earnings as dividends to shareholders, which can provide an additional
      income stream.
      <br><br>
      <h5>Basic Concepts</h5>

      1. Stock Exchange: Stock trading typically takes place on organized marketplaces called stock exchanges, such as
      the
      New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. These exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of stocks between
      buyers
      and sellers.<br>
      <br>
      2. Publicly Traded Companies: Stocks are available for companies that have decided to "go public" by conducting an
      initial public offering (IPO). This process allows companies to sell shares to the public and raise capital to
      fund
      their operations or expansion plans.<br>
      <br>
      3. Ticker Symbol: Each publicly traded company has a unique ticker symbol, a combination of letters usually
      representing the company's name or abbreviation. Ticker symbols are used to identify and trade specific
      stocks.<br>
      <br>
      4. Stock Price: The stock price represents the value of a single share of a company's stock at a given point in
      time. Stock prices can fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics, company performance, economic conditions,
      and
      other factors.<br>
      <br>
      5. Market Capitalization: Market capitalization, or market cap, refers to the total value of a company's
      outstanding
      shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the total number of shares outstanding. Market
      cap categorizes companies into different sizes, such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.<br>


      <br><br>
      <h5> Trading Process </h5>

      1. Brokerage Account: To trade stocks, you'll need a brokerage account. A brokerage account is a specialized
      account
      that allows you to buy and sell stocks, typically through an online platform provided by a brokerage firm.
      <br><br>
      2. Placing Orders: Once you have a brokerage account, you can place buy or sell orders for the stocks you want to
      trade. There are different types of orders, including market orders (buy or sell at the current market price) and
      limit orders (buy or sell at a specific price or better).
      <br><br>
      3. Bid and Ask Prices: When trading stocks, you'll encounter bid and ask prices. The bid price is the highest
      price
      a buyer is willing to pay for a stock, while the ask price is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The
      difference between the bid and ask prices is called the bid-ask spread.
      <br><br>
      4. Execution of Trades: When your buy or sell order matches with another trader's order, the trade is executed.
      This
      process is facilitated by the stock exchange, and the trade is reflected in your brokerage account.
      <br><br>

      Trading stocks involves buying and selling shares of publicly traded companies. Investors trade stocks to
      potentially earn a profit and benefit from company ownership. Understanding basic concepts like stock exchanges,
      ticker symbols, stock prices, and market capitalization is essential for beginners. By opening a brokerage
      account,
      you can participate in the stock market and execute trades based on your investment goals and strategies. Remember
      that investing in stocks carries risks, so it's important to conduct thorough research and seek professional
      advice
      before making investment decisions.

    <section id="technical-analysis">
      <h2>Technical Analysis </h2>
      Technical analysis is a valuable tool used by traders and investors to gain insights into the potential direction
      of
      stock prices. It operates on the premise that market prices are not completely random but instead follow trends
      and
      patterns that can be identified and analyzed.

      One of the primary components of technical analysis is charting. Charts display historical price data, such as
      stock
      prices over time, and allow analysts to visually identify patterns and trends. Common types of charts used in
      technical analysis include line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. By examining these charts, analysts
      can
      spot important price levels, such as support and resistance levels, as well as key chart patterns like trends,
      reversals, and consolidations.


      <br><br>
      Technical analysts also utilize various indicators to supplement their analysis. These indicators are mathematical
      calculations based on price and volume data and can provide additional insights into the strength and momentum of
      price movements. Examples of commonly used technical indicators include moving averages, relative strength index
      (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and stochastic oscillators. These indicators help traders
      identify potential entry and exit points for trades and provide signals for potential trend reversals or
      continuations.

      Furthermore, technical analysis incorporates the concept of support and resistance. Support refers to a price
      level
      at which buying pressure is expected to outweigh selling pressure, potentially causing the stock's price to
      "bounce"
      or reverse its downward trend. Resistance, on the other hand, represents a price level at which selling pressure
      is
      anticipated to surpass buying pressure, potentially causing the stock's price to stall or reverse its upward
      trend.
      Identifying these support and resistance levels can aid in setting price targets and determining stop-loss levels
      to
      manage risk.

      <br><br>
      It's important to note that technical analysis is not infallible and does not guarantee accurate predictions of
      future price movements. Factors such as market sentiment, economic news, and company-specific events can influence
      stock prices and cause them to deviate from predicted patterns. Therefore, technical analysis should be used in
      conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental analysis, to make well-rounded investment decisions.

      In summary, technical analysis is a method of analyzing historical price data, patterns, and indicators to
      forecast
      future price movements in the stock market. By studying charts, utilizing indicators, and identifying support and
      resistance levels, technical analysts aim to gain insights into potential trading opportunities. However, it's
      important to remember that technical analysis is just one tool among many in the investor's toolkit and should be
      used in conjunction with other forms of analysis for informed decision-making.


      <br><br>
      The field of technical analysis is based on three fundamental assumptions:
      <br><br>
      1. The market discounts everything:
      Technical analysis acknowledges that the market incorporates and reflects all available information, including
      fundamental factors such as company performance, economic conditions, and market sentiment. It recognizes that
      market prices are influenced by the collective actions and emotions of market participants. However, it is
      important
      to note that technical analysis focuses primarily on price and volume data rather than the underlying fundamental
      factors.
      <br><br>
      2. Price moves in trends:
      One of the core principles of technical analysis is that price movements tend to exhibit trends. Once a trend is
      established, it is more likely to continue than to reverse. Technical analysts utilize various tools and
      techniques,
      such as trend lines, moving averages, and indicators, to identify and follow these trends. By aligning their
      strategies with the prevailing trend, traders aim to increase the probability of successful trades.
      <br><br>
      3. History tends to repeat itself:
      Technical analysis recognizes that historical price patterns and behaviors often repeat themselves in the future.
      Market participants tend to react in similar ways to similar market conditions, leading to the formation of
      recognizable patterns. Technical analysts study these patterns, such as chart patterns, candlestick formations,
      and
      indicators, to anticipate future price movements. While history repeating itself is not guaranteed, it provides a
      framework for understanding market dynamics and making informed trading decisions.
      <br><br>
      However, it is important to acknowledge that technical analysis has its limitations. Critics argue that relying
      solely on price data and patterns may overlook important fundamental factors that can influence a stock's value.
      Therefore, it is often recommended to combine technical analysis with fundamental analysis to gain a more
      comprehensive understanding of the market and make well-informed investment decisions.

    <section id="technical-indicator">
      <h2>Technical Indicator</h2>
      A technical indicator is a mathematical formula applied to the price, volume, or open interest of a security. It
      generates a value that helps anticipate future price changes. These indicators provide a unique perspective on the
      strength and direction of price action within a specific timeframe.

      The use of indicators serves three main functions: alerting, confirming, and predicting. They can alert analysts
      to
      study price action or signal a potential breakout. Indicators can also confirm other technical analysis tools.
      Furthermore, investors and traders employ indicators to predict future price directions.
      <br><br>
      When using indicators, it is important to remember that they should not replace the analysis of price action but
      rather filter it through mathematical formulas. Analysts should assess what the indicators reveal about a
      security's
      price action—whether it is becoming stronger or weaker.
      <br><br>
      It is advisable to consider indicators alongside other technical analysis tools such as candlestick patterns,
      trends, and chart patterns. The interpretation of buy and sell signals from indicators should be viewed in the
      context of the overall analysis. For example, a buy signal from an indicator may be misleading if the chart
      pattern
      indicates a descending triangle with declining peaks.

      Careful selection of indicators is crucial. It is best to focus on two or three indicators and thoroughly
      understand
      their intricacies. Choose indicators that complement each other rather than those that produce redundant signals.
      For instance, using two indicators that both measure momentum and identify overbought/oversold levels, such as
      Stochastic and RSI, would be redundant.
      <br><br>
      In summary, technical indicators are valuable tools that, when used in conjunction with other analysis techniques,
      provide insights into price action and aid in identifying optimal entry and exit points. However, their selection,
      interpretation, and integration with other analysis methods require careful consideration.
      <br><br>
      <h2>Type of Indicators</h2>
      Indicators can be classified into two types: leading and lagging indicators.
      <br><br>
      Leading indicators are designed to anticipate price movements and provide early signals for entry and exit points.
      They generate more trading opportunities and represent price momentum over a specific look-back period. Common
      leading indicators include the Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Momentum, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic
      Oscillator, and Williams %R.
      <br><br>
      Lagging indicators, on the other hand, follow trends rather than predict reversals. They are based on past price
      data and work well in long-lasting trends. Lagging indicators do not provide warnings for upcoming price changes
      but
      instead inform you about the current direction of prices, enabling you to make investments accordingly. Examples
      of
      lagging indicators include moving averages and the MACD, which are trend-following indicators.
      <br><br>
      In summary, leading indicators lead price movements and offer early signals, while lagging indicators follow
      trends
      and inform about the current price direction.

    <section id="Indicators">
      <h2>Indicators</h2>
      <h5>Moving Averages</h5>
      Moving averages are widely used trend-following indicators that help identify trends in volatile markets. They
      smooth data series, making it easier to spot trends, and serve as the foundation for numerous technical indicators
      and overlays. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are the two most popular
      types of moving averages.
      <br><br>
      <h5>Simple moving average (SMA)</h5>
      A simple moving average is calculated by averaging the closing prices of a security over a specified number of
      periods. It assigns equal importance to each price within the chosen timeframe. While moving averages can be based
      on the Open, High, or Low data points, the most common approach uses the closing price. For instance, a 5-day
      simple
      moving average is determined by summing the closing prices of the past 5 days and dividing the total by 5.
      <br><br>
      <h5>Exponential moving average (EMA)</h5>
      Known as the exponentially weighted moving average, assigns more weight to recent prices compared to older prices.
      Technicians use EMA to reduce lag in simple moving averages. The weight given to the most recent price depends on
      the specified period of the moving average. A shorter EMA period applies more weight to the latest price. For
      example, a 10-period EMA weighs the most recent price by 18.18%, while a 20-period EMA weighs it by 9.52%.
      Calculating an EMA is more complex than calculating an SMA, but it reacts faster to recent price changes.
      <br><br>
      <h2>Signals</h2>
      A price break above a moving average (MA) indicates a buy signal, while a break below the MA indicates a sell
      signal. The significance of a crossover signal increases with a longer time span covered by the MA. If the MA is
      flat or has changed direction, its violation is strong evidence of a trend reversal. To avoid false signals, it is
      recommended to wait for one period (e.g., one day for daily data). Combining MA crossovers with trend line
      violations or price pattern signals provides strong confirmation.
      <br><br>
      <h5>Signals - multiple moving averages</h5>
      Using multiple moving averages (MAs) is advantageous in generating signals. Double and triple MAs are particularly
      useful.
      In the case of two MAs, a double crossover is employed. A sell signal occurs when the short-term MA crosses below
      the long-term MA, and vice versa. Common combinations include the 5-day and 20-day averages, as well as the 20-day
      and 100-day averages. Although the technique of using two averages lags the market slightly more, it produces
      fewer
      whipsaws (false signals).
      The triple moving average crossover system is popular among investors. The widely used combination is the
      4-9-18-day
      MA. A buy signal is generated when the shortest (and most sensitive) average, the 4-day MA, first crosses the
      9-day
      MA and then the 18-day MA. Each crossover confirms the change in trend.

      <h2>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
      The RSI is part of a class of indicators called momentum oscillators.
      There are a number of indicators that fall in this category, the most common being Relative
      Strength Index, Stochastic, Rate of Change, Williams %R. Although these indicators are all
      calculated differently, there are a number of common elements to their use which shall be
      discussed in the context of the RSI.
      <br><br>
      The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular technical indicator used by traders to assess the strength and
      momentum of price movements. While it is commonly applied in sideways or ranging markets, it can also be used in
      trending markets to identify overbought and oversold conditions. Here's how the RSI can be applied for generating
      buy and sell signals based on overbought and oversold levels:
      <br><br>
      1. RSI Range: The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100, with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions and
      values
      below 30 indicating oversold conditions. These levels are commonly used as thresholds for generating signals.
      <br><br>
      2. Overbought Signals: When the RSI crosses above the overbought line (e.g., 70), it suggests that the market is
      overextended on the upside, and a potential reversal or correction may occur. Traders may consider selling or
      taking
      profits in this situation, expecting a downward price movement.
      <br><br>
      3. Oversold Signals: When the RSI crosses below the oversold line (e.g., 30), it suggests that the market is
      oversold, and a potential rebound or reversal may take place. Traders may consider buying or entering long
      positions, expecting an upward price movement.
      <br><br>
      4. Direction of Crossing: It's important to note the direction of the RSI crossing the overbought or oversold
      lines.
      For a valid signal, the RSI should first move past the overbought/oversold level and then cross back through it.
      This confirms a potential change in momentum and provides a clearer indication for entering or exiting trades.
      <br><br>
      To summarize:
      - Go long (buy) when the RSI moves from below the oversold line (e.g., 30) to above it, indicating a potential
      bullish reversal.
      - Go short (sell) when the RSI moves from above the overbought line (e.g., 70) to below it, indicating a potential
      bearish reversal.
      <br><br>
      It's important to remember that the RSI is just one tool among many in technical analysis, and it's always
      recommended to use it in conjunction with other indicators or analysis techniques for confirmation and to consider
      the broader market context.
      <br><br>

      <h2>Stochastic indicator</h2>

      The Stochastic indicator, developed by George Lane, is a momentum oscillator that compares a security's closing
      price to its price range over a selected number of periods. The most commonly used period is 14 days. The
      Stochastic
      indicator is represented by "%K," which is a mathematical ratio.

      To calculate the %K value using the Stochastic indicator, the following formula is used:
      <br><br>
      %K = ((Today's Close) - (Lowest Low over a selected period)) / ((Highest High over a selected period) - (Lowest
      Low
      over a selected period))
      <br>
      For example, let's consider today's close at 50, and the highest and lowest prices over the last 14 days were 55
      and
      40, respectively. Applying the formula, we get:
      <br>
      %K = (50 - 40) / (55 - 40)
      = 0.666
      <br>
      To present the %K value in a more standardized and easily interpretable format, the resulting decimal value is
      typically multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage:
      <br>
      %K = 0.666 * 100
      = 66.6%
      <br>
      Therefore, in this example, the %K value would be 66.6%.
      <br><br>
      The Stochastic indicator is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. It oscillates
      between
      0 and 100, with values above 80 generally considered overbought, and values below 20 considered oversold. Traders
      often look for signals when the %K line crosses above or below these thresholds to generate buy or sell signals,
      respectively. Additionally, the Stochastic indicator is frequently used in conjunction with its accompanying "%D"
      line, which is a moving average of the %K line, to further refine trading signals.

      The Stochastic indicator is commonly used by traders to interpret potential overbought and oversold conditions in
      the market. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and provides insights into the momentum and strength of price
      movements.
      Here's how the Stochastic indicator can be interpreted:
      <br><br>
      1. Overbought Conditions: When the Stochastic indicator (%K) rises above 80, it suggests that the price of the
      security has moved into overbought territory. This means that the price has experienced a significant upward move
      and may be due for a potential reversal or correction. Traders may consider selling or taking profits in this
      situation.
      <br><br>
      2. Oversold Conditions: When the Stochastic indicator (%K) falls below 20, it indicates that the price of the
      security has entered oversold territory. This means that the price has experienced a significant downward move and
      may be due for a potential rebound or reversal. Traders may consider buying or entering long positions in
      anticipation of a price increase.
      <br><br>
      3. Bullish and Bearish Divergences: Divergences can occur between the Stochastic indicator and the price action. A
      bullish divergence happens when the price makes a lower low, but the Stochastic indicator forms a higher low. This
      can indicate a potential reversal and a bullish signal. Conversely, a bearish divergence occurs when the price
      makes
      a higher high, but the Stochastic indicator forms a lower high, suggesting a potential reversal and a bearish
      signal.
      <br><br>
      4. Signal Line Crossovers: The Stochastic indicator is often used in conjunction with its accompanying "%D" line,
      which is a moving average of the %K line. Traders look for crossovers between the %K and %D lines as potential buy
      or sell signals. For example, a buy signal may be generated when the %K line crosses above the %D line, indicating
      a
      shift towards bullish momentum. Conversely, a sell signal may be generated when the %K line crosses below the %D
      line, indicating a shift towards bearish momentum.
      <br><br>
      It's important to note that the Stochastic indicator is most effective in ranging or sideways markets. In trending
      markets, the indicator can stay in overbought or oversold conditions for extended periods, leading to false
      signals.
      Therefore, it's recommended to use the Stochastic indicator in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and
      consider the broader market context for more reliable trading decisions.


      <h2>Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)</h2>

      The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is a widely used technical analysis indicator created by Gerald
      Appel in the late 1970s. It is considered a refinement of the two moving averages system and provides insights
      into
      the relationship between two moving average lines. The MACD is calculated using the following components:
      <br><br>
      1. MACD Line (MACD): The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the longer-term exponential moving average (EMA)
      from the shorter-term EMA. The most common settings are a 12-period EMA subtracted from a 26-period EMA. The MACD
      line represents the convergence and divergence of these two moving averages.
      <br><br>
      2. Signal Line (Signal): The signal line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line. It acts as a trigger line and helps
      identify potential buy and sell signals.
      <br><br>
      3. MACD Histogram: The MACD histogram represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. It
      provides a visual representation of the relationship between the two lines. The histogram fluctuates above and
      below
      a zero line, indicating positive and negative divergence, respectively.
      <br><br>
      Interpreting the MACD indicator involves analyzing the relationship between the MACD line, signal line, and
      histogram. Here are some common interpretations:
      <br><br>
      1. MACD Line and Signal Line Crossovers: When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a bullish
      signal, suggesting that it may be a good time to buy. Conversely, when the MACD line crosses below the signal
      line,
      it generates a bearish signal, indicating a potential selling opportunity.
      <br><br>
      2. MACD Histogram: The histogram provides additional insights into the strength and momentum of the price
      movement.
      When the histogram moves above the zero line, it indicates increasing bullish momentum. Conversely, when the
      histogram moves below the zero line, it suggests increasing bearish momentum.
      <br><br>
      3. Divergences: Divergences occur when the MACD indicator disagrees with the price action. For example, if the
      price
      makes a higher high, but the MACD histogram forms a lower high, it indicates a bearish divergence, potentially
      signaling a trend reversal. Conversely, a bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower low, but the MACD
      histogram forms a higher low, indicating a potential bullish reversal.
      <br><br>
      Traders often use the MACD indicator in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and consider the broader
      market context to make informed trading decisions.
      <br><br>
      <h2> Flow Index (MFI)</h2>

      The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical analysis indicator that incorporates volume data to measure the strength
      of money flowing in and out of a security. It is also referred to as a smart money flow indicator. The MFI
      calculation is based on the concepts of positive and negative money flow. Here's how the MFI is calculated and
      interpreted:
      <br><br>
      Positive Money Flow (PMF): When the average price of a day is higher than the average price of the previous day,
      it
      is considered positive money flow. The positive money flow for a specific day is calculated by multiplying the
      average price by the volume.
      <br><br>
      Negative Money Flow (NMF): When the average price of a day is lower than the average price of the previous day, it
      is considered negative money flow. The negative money flow for a specific day is calculated by multiplying the
      average price by the volume.
      <br><br>
      Money Ratio: The money ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of positive money flow over a specified number of
      periods by the sum of negative money flow over the same number of periods.
      <br><br>
      Money Flow Index (MFI): The MFI is calculated using the money ratio. It is derived from the formula: MFI = 100 -
      100
      / (1 + money ratio).
      <br><br>
      Interpreting the Money Flow Index (MFI) involves the following guidelines:
      <br><br>
      Overbought Conditions: When the MFI reaches a high level, typically above 80, it suggests that the security is
      overbought. This means that the buying pressure has been strong and may be due for a potential reversal or
      consolidation. Traders may consider selling or taking profits in this situation.
      <br><br>
      Oversold Conditions: When the MFI falls to a low level, typically below 20, it indicates that the security is
      oversold. This means that selling pressure has been strong and may be due for a potential rebound or reversal.
      Traders may consider buying or entering long positions in anticipation of a price increase.
      <br><br>
      Divergences: Similar to other oscillators, divergences between the MFI and price action can provide valuable
      signals. A bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower low, but the MFI forms a higher low. This
      suggests
      a potential bullish reversal. Conversely, a bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the
      MFI forms a lower high, indicating a potential bearish reversal.
      <br><br>
      As with any technical indicator, it's important to use the Money Flow Index (MFI) in conjunction with other
      analysis
      tools and consider the broader market context for more accurate trading decisions.

      <h2> Bollinger Bands</h2>

      Bollinger bands are trading bands developed by John Bollinger.
      It consists of a 20 period simple moving average with upper and lower bands. The upper band
      is 2 standard deviation above the moving average and similarly lower band is 2 standard
      deviation below the moving average. This makes these bands more dynamic and adaptive to
      volatility.

      Here's how Bollinger Bands are constructed and how they can be interpreted:
      <br><br>
      1. Construction of Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: the middle band, the upper band, and
      the
      lower band.

      - Middle Band: The middle band is a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) of the price. It represents the average
      price over the selected period.

      - Upper Band: The upper band is located two standard deviations above the middle band. It provides an upper
      boundary
      or resistance level.

      - Lower Band: The lower band is located two standard deviations below the middle band. It serves as a lower
      boundary
      or support level.
      <br><br>
      2. Volatility Contraction and Expansion: Bollinger Bands are known for their ability to adapt to market
      volatility.
      When the bands tighten or contract, it indicates lower volatility in the market. This contraction is often
      followed
      by a period of increased volatility or a significant price move in either direction.
      <br><br>
      3. Support and Resistance Levels: The upper band serves as a resistance level, while the lower band acts as a
      support level. When the price approaches the upper band, it suggests that the security is overbought and may
      encounter selling pressure. Conversely, when the price approaches the lower band, it indicates that the security
      is
      oversold and may experience buying pressure.
      <br><br>
      4. Breakouts: Breakouts occur when the price moves outside of the Bollinger Bands. A breakout above the upper band
      suggests a continuation of the upward trend, while a breakout below the lower band indicates a continuation of the
      downward trend. Traders often consider breakouts as potential buying or selling opportunities.
      <br><br>
      5. Reversal Signals: Reversal signals can be identified when significant price tops or bottoms are formed outside
      the bands, followed by subsequent tops or bottoms formed inside the bands. This pattern suggests a potential
      reversal in the current trend.
      <br><br>
      It's important to note that Bollinger Bands are not definitive buy or sell signals on their own. They are most
      effective when used in conjunction with other technical indicators and analysis tools. Additionally, traders
      should
      consider the overall market conditions and use proper risk management techniques when interpreting Bollinger
      Bands.

      <h5>Trading market tool kit application</h5>
      1) Moving Averages — Fade breakouts
      <br><br>
      2) RSI, and Oscillators — Sell overbought, buy oversold
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastic — Sell crossovers to downside and buy crossovers to upside
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume — Useless as forecasting indicators but can be viable
      as confirming indicators
      <br><br>
      5) Elliott Wave — Verifies the existence of trading market via flat-type corrections classification
      and shows possible end of trading range

      <h5>Bull market tool kit application</h5>
      1) Moving Averages — Buy the upside crossovers
      <br><br>
      2) RSI, and Oscillators—Buy oversold indicators and ignore the overbought indicators
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastics—Buy the crossovers to the upside; do not sell crossovers to the downside
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume—Useless as forecasting indicators, but viable as
      confirming indicators, since OBV curves would continually display new breakout highs

      <br><br>
      2) RSI, and Oscillators—Sell the overbought indicators and ignore the oversold indicators
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastics — Sell the crossovers to the downside; do not buy crossovers to the upside
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume — Too late for forecasting, and non- effective as
      confirming indicators
      <br><br>
      5) Elliott Wave — Sell the breakdowns of previous lows
      <br><br>
      <h5> Trading market changing to bull market toolkit application</h5>
      1) Moving Averages — If traders are fading the false breakouts in the trading market, one
      trade will finally go against them for a greater than normal loss (short in a bull market).
      This will signal to them that the markets are about to change.
      <br><br>
      2) RSI, and Oscillators — If traders have been selling overbought and buying oversold, they
      will find a trade which will show a loss even though they sold the overbought signal (short
      in the bull market). This will signal to them that the markets are changing.
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastics — Traders must buy all crossovers from the oversold conditions and not
      execute trades on overbought signals.
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume — Accumulation can be observed and hence eventual
      upside price breakouts can be forecasted with high accuracy.
      <br><br>
      5) Elliott Wave — The theory will show a possible breakout to the upside. Cautiously buy
      at the trading range for an impending move and aggressively buy when the price breaks
      into new highs moving above the trading range high.
      <br><br>
      <h5>Trading market changing to bear market toolkit application</h5>
      <br><br>
      1) Moving Averages — If traders had been fading the false breakouts to the upside and false
      breakdowns to the downside in a trading market, they would find their last trade to be a
      disproportionate loss (long in a bear market). There really isn’t much chance to recoup
      this loss because the breakdown is fast and severe. It is best not to fade the markets on
      the buy side using moving averages after the markets have had a severe run up going
      into a trading range market.
      <br><br>
      2) RSI, %R and Oscillators — If traders had been selling overbought and buying oversold
      indicators in a trading market, they would suffer a large loss on the last trade. Traders
      would also find a growing number of oversold indicators and a diminishing number of
      overbought signals using standard parameters. This signals an impending change in the
      state of the market condition.
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastic — Crossovers from the overbought side to the downside are more valid than
      crossovers to the upside from the oversold level.
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume — These two indicators are unreliable for forewarning
      traders of impending weakness. The best that traders can expect from these indicators
      is a flattening of the OBV pattern, implying a possible, but not certain, breakdown. The
      prices would drop dramatically and then the volume indicators would indicate a breakdown.
      <br><br>
      5) Elliott Wave — In Elliott Wave corrections, traders have a one-in-two chance that
      the correction could possibly turn into a bear market sell-off (a zigzag instead of a
      flat correction). However, in the formation of this correction traders cannot tell until
      they approach the forecasted event that the correction could turn into a bear market
      correction instead of a flat correction. If the market turns into a bear market correction
      they only have to sell into new lows and maintain a short position to profit from the move
      downwards. If, however, it turns into a flat correction, they will find themselves selling
      the bottom. Elliott Wave analysis does offer inkling about what type of correction traders
      can expect, based on the existence of alternative patterns prior to the one currently
      under examination.

      1) Moving Averages — Price finally crosses the moving averages to the downside after
      leading the averages from above. If traders didn’t buy the price breakout to the upside,
      traders mustn’t do it now but, instead, start to fade the upside breakouts carefully and
      fade the downside breakdowns.
      <br><br>
      2) RSI, and Oscillators — After a solid series of bad overbought signals in the bull market,
      traders finally find more oversold indicators appearing. As the trading market continues,
      oversold and overbought indicators become equal in number. The fact that the numbers
      Even out indicates the complexion of the market is changing from uptrend to trading.
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastics — In the bull trend, the crossovers from overbought were more often than
      not false signals and the crossovers from oversold, if they did happen, were valid buy
      signals. Now, as the market flattens out, traders will find the crossovers from either side
      to be valid and can also initiate positions with profitability.
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume — This technique fails when you try to use it to
      forecast imminent price breakdowns. These cumulative volume indicators would not begin
      to signal distribution until price deterioration was well underway. The best signal that could
      be emitted would be a flattening of the price trend signal.
      <br><br>
      5) Elliott Wave — According to strict Elliott Wave tenets, this application does not exist per
      se: A bull market turns to a bear market upon its completion. Elliott Wave would not
      consider the existence of trading to bear market designation, but bull to bear immediately.
      Yet, traders can observe that the two types of corrective markets alternate with each
      other: if a previous correction was one of two types (flat or zigzag) then the second of
      the set will be the alternate type to the first. In this way, traders can predict something
      about the nature of this market phase

      <h5>Bear market changing to trading market tool kit application</h5>
      1) Moving Averages — When the market changes to a trading market from a bear market
      the moving averages will no longer lag as far behind the actual price or shorter moving
      average as was the case in the preceding bear market. Traders can now expect a
      flattening out of the moving average curve to correspond with the flattening of market
      prices. If they continued to sell the breakdowns and defer from buying as before, they
      would be continually whipsawed (instead, they should sell the breakouts and buy the
      breakdowns).
      <br><br>
      2) RSI, and Oscillators — In the bear down trend traders would have an overwhelming
      number of oversold signals and a dearth of overbought signals. They could have adjusted
      the overbought parameter to the downside to give themselves, in effect, “overbought”
      signals to initiate short positions on. At the changing point, the number of oversold and
      overbought signals begin to equal each other in numbers. They could sell the overbought
      and buy the oversold with confidence at this point.
      <br><br>
      3) Stochastics — During the bear market, crossovers from the oversold side were less valid
      as buy signals than crossovers from the overbought side were as sell signals. They will
      now appear equally valid as the trading market appears.
      <br><br>
      4) On-Balance Volume and Tic Volume — The OBV curve and Tic Volume flatten out after
      the bottom price is made, thereby giving traders an after-the-fact confirmation of the
      end of the down move, but not a reliable anticipatory signal.
      <br><br>
      5) Elliott Wave — The ‘bear move down’ would have been an impulse wave down and the
      the trading market would have been a corrective wave to this. Once traders have determined
      which of the three impulse waves (1,3, or 5 of an impulse 1-2-3-4-5, or even in a larger
      dimension or c of an a-b-c correction) they were in the process of completing they would
      have a better idea of what type of correction is starting.
